    <h2>Chicken wings befitting a shogun!</h2>
    <p>
      Japanese Chicken Wings are baked with a light and crispy coating in an
      Asian-inspired sauce prepared with soy sauce, vinegar, and sugar. They are
      super moist and tender on the inside with a golden crispy skin on the
      outside.
    </p>
    <p>It’s hard to share these wings, because they’re just so delicious!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 large egg, lightly beaten</li>
      <li>1 cup all-purpose flour for coating</li>
      <li>3 pounds chicken wings</li>
      <li>1 cup butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Sauce</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
      <li>½ cup white vinegar</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons water</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder, or to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
      <li>Place beaten egg in a small bowl. Place flour in a shallow bowl.</li>
      <li>
        Cut wings in half. Dip each piece in egg, then press in flour to coat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Melt butter in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat. Fry coated
        wings in hot butter until deep brown on both sides. Place in a shallow
        roasting pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make sauce: Mix together sugar, vinegar, soy sauce, water, salt, and
        garlic powder in a medium bowl until combined. Pour over wings.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 45 minutes, basting wings
        frequently with sauce in the roasting pan. An instant-read thermometer
        inserted into the centers of wings near the bone should read 165 degrees
        F (74 degrees C).
      </li>
    </ol>
